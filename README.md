# ScrapeZohoProjects
Python script to login to Zoho Projects and scrape Task and Issue lists from all projects

This python scripts logs in to zoho projects with provided credentials, extract list of projects from landing page.
It will then visit each project page and extract list of Tasks and Issues

Why Scrape when Zoho projects provides APIs for data extraction? For 2 reasons::
1.This is usefull if you dont have admin access to projects and cannot authenticate API key
2. Scaping web is fun :)
